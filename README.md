In the game HAM, the player navigates a 4-part musical transmission through the
depths of space whilst dodging an array of space junk. Lose any of your 4
frequencies and lose the instrument with which it corresponds. The player can
smash through meteors with frequencies if the frequency color matches the meteor
color. Lose all four frequencies and your transmission is lost.
